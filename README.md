# MM
Question 6 of MM assignment.

In the MM 6 folder:
- Folder data stores the data which are used to train and test the model.
- Folder savedmodels stores the trained model.
- File ODE_euler_load_predict.py takes trained model from savedmodels for testing purpose.
- File ODE_euler_save_train.py trains the model and store to savemodels and plotting the loss in training.
- File ODE_euler_train.py only trains the model. This file is to be added more code to show the differents of Before and After training session.
